# Interactive SVG Path Animation

This project demonstrates an interactive SVG path animation using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library. The animation allows users to manipulate the path of an SVG element by moving the mouse, creating a dynamic and responsive effect.

## Demo

To see the animation in action, follow the setup instructions below and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Move your mouse over the SVG element to see the path change dynamically.

## Features

- Interactive path manipulation using mouse movements.
- Smooth animations powered by GSAP.
- Responsive design that adapts to user interactions.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable) or **Download the Files**:
   - If you have a Git repository, clone it using:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Otherwise, download the `index.html` and any associated JavaScript files.

2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the interactive SVG path animation.
2. Move your mouse over the SVG element to dynamically change the path.
3. The path will return to its original state when the mouse leaves the SVG element.

## Customization

- **SVG Path**: Modify the `initialPath` and `finalPath` variables in the JavaScript code to change the default path of the SVG element.
- **Animation Speed**: Adjust the `duration` property in the GSAP animations to change the speed of the path transitions.
- **Easing**: Customize the easing functions in the GSAP animations to achieve different animation effects.

## Dependencies

- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/): Used for creating smooth animations. Included via CDN in the `index.html` file.
